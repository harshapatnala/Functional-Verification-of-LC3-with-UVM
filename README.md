# Functional-Verification-of-LC3-with-UVM
This project deals with the chip-level functional verification of pipelined LC3 microprocessor with UVM. The project is split into parts based on the five block stages of the design. Currently, I am working at the block-level verification of the decode stage of the processor. At this point, the test environment is built for the decode stage based on UVM component hierarchy.  Part of this project is executed using the UVMF code generator.
